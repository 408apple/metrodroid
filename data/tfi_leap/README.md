# Transport for Ireland GTFS

All data is available [from Transport for Ireland's PT data site][tfi-gtfs].

All the stop IDs used in Ireland appear to be globally unique.

All the stop names in the GTFS data appear to be in English, unless the canonical name is Irish.

## TODOs

* Figure out how to support Irish stop/station names properly.

* Check the information we have in Irish with someone who is actually fluent (rather than me
  guessing...)
