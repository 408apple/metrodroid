title: Metrodroid Privacy and Permissions Statement
permalink: /privacy
---

Metrodroid uses some permissions in order to allow the application to function:

* **Internet access:** Used by the map viewer (Leaflet) to show the location of
  trips.

* **NFC:** Required to read NFC cards.

* **Photos / Media / Files:** Used to load and save scanned cards from/to a
  user-specified file.

Metrodroid does not share card data with third parties without consent.

Metrodroid does not communicate with your card's issuing agency without consent.
Metrodroid's card readers operate entirely offline.

Google Play may also collect other analytics, and forward crash logs to the
developers. These crash logs can contain raw card data.

This statement only applies to [Metrodroid distributed via the Google Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.id.micolous.farebot).

If in doubt, on Android 6.0 and later, you can selectively revoke permissions.
