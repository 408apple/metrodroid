There's a lot of cards in the world, and asking for a card by name isn't good enough to get it supported.

**We do not record expressions of interest here.**

## New card checklist

- [ ] I have read and acknowledged the New cards wiki page.
- [ ] I can provide dumps, transaction history, and balance records for more than one card from the operator.
- [ ] I have attempted to understand the card format on my own.
- [ ] I have provided notes on what I've found so far.

### Please answer all questions listed here:

- Name of the card:
- Name of the transit agency:
- Transit agency's website:
- Location(s):
- Card media:

Is there any publicly accessible documentation for this card format?  If so, provide links:

Is the card similar to one we already support? (if you don't know, that's OK)

Is there an official app for using the card?

What are the AIDs used on the card?
