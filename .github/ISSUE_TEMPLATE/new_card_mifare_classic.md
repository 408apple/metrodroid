There's a lot of cards in the world, and asking for a card by name isn't good enough to get it supported.

**We do not record expressions of interest here.**

Please read https://github.com/metrodroid/metrodroid/wiki/New-cards before continuing.

## New card checklist

- [ ] I have read and acknowledged the New cards wiki page.
- [ ] I can provide dumps, transaction history, and balance records for more than one card from the operator.
- [ ] I have attempted to understand the card format on my own.
- [ ] I have provided notes on what I've found so far.

## Please answer all questions listed here:

- Name of the card:
- Name of the transit agency:
- Transit agency's website:
- Location(s):
- Card media: MIFARE Classic

Is there any publicly accessible documentation for this card format?  If so, provide links:

Is the card similar to one we already support?

Is there an official app for using the card?

How many sectors does this card have?

Did the card use any "default" key that comes with Metrodroid?

Does the card use diversified keys, static keys, or a combination?

After installing proper keys, how many sectors could you read with Metrodroid (ie: not "unauthorized")?

With the data that you can read from the card, does it change after performing a transaction?
