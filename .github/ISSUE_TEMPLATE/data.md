Thanks for letting us know!

If you have more than one thing to report for a card, please put them all in one issue, rather than opening multiple issues at once.

Tip: When reporting incorrect information, you'll need to enable "show raw station and route IDs" in Metrodroid's "Developer options" screen to always show IDs, even if the station is known.

Tip: if you want to send a pull request instead, take a look at the "data" directory in Metrodroid's source code.

(Please delete this line and above before submitting.)
