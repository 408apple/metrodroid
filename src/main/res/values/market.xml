Farebot M can read information from some public transport NFC smartcards.

This is a fork of Eric Butler's Farebot project, with support for additional cards and bug fixes.

Supported cards:
- Bilhete Único - São Paulo, Brazil [1] [2]
- Clipper - San Francisco, CA, USA
- EZ-Link - Singapore [3]
- Go card - Brisbane and South East Queensland, Australia [0] [1] [2]
- Manly Fast Ferry - Sydney, Australia [0] [1] [2]
- Matkakortti, HSL - Finland
- Myki - Victoria, Australia [0] [4]
- NETS Flashpay - Singapore
- Opal - Sydney, Australia [0]
- ORCA - Seattle, WA, USA
- OV-chipkaart - Netherlands [1] [2]
- Suica, IOCOA, PASMO, Edy - Japan

[0]: New in Metrodroid.
[1]: Not compatible with all devices (Mifare Classic).
[2]: Encryption keys are required to read this card.
[3]: Not compatible with all devices (CEPAS).
[4]: Only the card number can be read.

You require a NFC-compatible phone in order to read cards.

You need a NXP NFC chipset in your phone in order to read MIFARE Classic cards.  Some phones have NFC chips from other manufacturers, which do not read Mifare Classic cards (eg: Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy S4). Check the About screen in the app in order to determine if your phone supports MIFARE Classic.

Some agencies have encrypted cards. You will need to acquire encryption keys in order to read them. These are generally unique to each card. Sorry, I can't help you with this.
