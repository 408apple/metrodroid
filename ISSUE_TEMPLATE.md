Make sure that these boxes are checked before submitting a new issue.  Thanks!

- [ ] I'm using the current release version of Metrodroid, or current `master`.

If the card uses **Mifare Classic**:

- [ ] I have a phone with an NXP NFC chipset (About screen says: `Mifare Classic: Supported`).
- [ ] I have acquired valid encryption keys for the card I'm trying to scan, and I've verified this with another app/phone/device, or it uses one of the default encryption keys.
- [ ] [I'm not asking for the encryption keys for my card, or help cracking them.](https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/Cracking-keys)

If the card is **not** presently supported by Metrodroid:

- [ ] [I have read and acknowledged the New cards wiki page](https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/New-cards)
- [ ] I can provide dumps, transaction history, and balance records for more than one card from the operator.
- [ ] I have attempted to understand the card format on my own.
- [ ] I have provided notes on what I've found so far.

Please provide:

- All device and version info from the application's about screen.

- The name of the card and transit operator, and a link to their web site.

- If reporting card decoding issues (eg: balance is reported incorrectly for a supported card), provide dumps of the affected card by email.
