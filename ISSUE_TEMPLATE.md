## Unsupported card requests

If the card is **not** presently supported by Metrodroid:

- [ ] [I have read and acknowledged the New cards wiki page](https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/wiki/New-cards)
- [ ] I can provide dumps, transaction history, and balance records for more than one card from the operator.
- [ ] I have attempted to understand the card format on my own.
- [ ] I have provided notes on what I've found so far.

## Description of the issue


## For card-specific issues

- Name of the card type:
